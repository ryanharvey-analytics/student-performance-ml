# Student Performance Machine Learning Project

This project develops machine learning models to predict student final grades using behavioral, demographic, and academic features.

A key objective was to evaluate predictive performance under two real-world scenarios:

- **With Grades** — using prior-term grades for later-stage intervention
- **Without Grades** — early detection before grades are available

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Support Vector Machine Regression

## Key Insight
Separating the modeling strategy based on intervention timing provided a more realistic framework for applying predictive analytics in an educational setting.

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` – Model development workflows
- `figures/` – Visualizations and performance outputs
- `models/` – Model artifacts and evaluation summaries
